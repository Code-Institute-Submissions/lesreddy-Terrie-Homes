[Totally Wild Tetris](https://lesreddy.github.io/tw-tetris/) is a colourful animal themed version of the classic brick building game that was first released back in [1984!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) 
Features include 10 levels, a realtime score, level and time update all designed in a simple and colourful way.  As a beginner developer the main purpose of this project was to improve my skills in Javascript which whilst I enjoy I currently find very challenging!

## UX


### Goals

The primary purpose of this page was to create a professional clean site that connects successfully to mongodb without the use of a css framework in order to strengthen my pure css knowledge and skills.

### User Stories

As a user I want the following:

1. Clear clean design with simple functionality 

2.  It to be aesthetically pleasing

3.  To use it as a tool to facilitate a process (ie sell a house)

4.  Responsiveness


### Design

**Fonts**

Primary font chosen was **Montserrat** to give a jungle feel to the game and ensure a fun theme is created.

Secondary font was **Esteban** which contrasts well with the primary choice of font but also allows a clearer 

**Background-Images**

Each image was designed to produce a contrasting vibrant colour linked in to the totally wild theme.  Each image represents a new level and a new animal with the lion being the last level.

**Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme is meant to potray strong bright and colourful images against a contrasting darker background.  I do believe this is achieved.


### Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent) was used to create the wireframes.

## Features

### Current Features

1.  Ability to sign up to an account and login.

2.  Ability to add a house listing through a user assigned dashboard.

3.  Able to select different pages using the navbar, which responsively adjusts to a nice JS dropdown menu.

4.  Login and Sign Up pages responsively adjust.

5.  Contact page is operational through EmailJS

6.  Data added is displayed in an accordion style via the final page.

### Remaining Features to Create

1. Add more features to the dashboard including an images upload section and a location API such as google to pinpoint location.

2. Add the callout to the listings page using an image slider to showcase sample houses for sale (it was designed but ran out of time to implement)

3. Improve overall css code efficiency and quality.

4. Implement the best back end and front end process for the user uploading and image and then iterating through a database and then rendering it automatically on the  listing page once approved by admin.  

5. Implement modals to lets the user know their listing erros such as the username already exists and also after they have successfully submitted their listing.

6. Create Social Media Pages

## Applied Technologies

The following technologies were used to construct the site:

1. [Gitpod](https://https://www.gitpod.io/) - a lightweight but powerful cloud based editor linked through Github. 
2. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used to style the website fonts.
3. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - CDN for Icons.
4. [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com/) - A site which enables email communication directly via Javascript ensuring the contact page is fully operational without the need for server code.
5. [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is the database for this project.
6. [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store and share all project code remotely. 
7. [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for installation of tools needed in this project.
8. [Git](https://git-scm.com/about) to handle version control.

### Libraries



### Languages

1. HTML - Created a file called [Index.html]
2. CSS - Created a file called [style.css]
3. Javascript - Created a file called [app.js]

### Responsiveness

Without using Bootstrap this proved challenging, however it helped me hone more skills in css and flexbox by sticking with a more pure approach.  If anything it showed me how much I still need to learn. 


### Validation

* Ran [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the css file and also [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the html markup.

### User Stories

As a user I want to

1. Create an account and then log in to access my dashboard.

This is achieved and the user can immediately access their dashboard.

2.  Perform multiple value added tasks and gather other relevant information through the dashboard.

This is not yet achieved as currently the user can only add their listing to the site.

3.  Navigate through a professional clean site simply and easily.

This is achieved using a professional theme and simple clear typography and design.

4.  Contact the company if required.

This is achieved through the contact page.

5.  Use social media to get in touch

This is not yet achieved, pages need to be created and links included accordingly.


### Bugs

### Media

Images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).  

[Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) was used to compress images from high res state to maintain quality.

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) was also used to re-size images down for implementing onto [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) for this readme file.

## Reflections

By enlarge this project has been quite difficult and at times a very frustrating process.  The idea was to utilise a purely javascript game and re-build it in my own way.  The problem was that it took me two weeks just to build the basic game engine and even after significant analysis I found it very difficult to understand the code, which costed more time than expected.  This then gave me less time and confidence to build the other elements of the game.

There are still many elements to implement in order to complete it and I am not happy with the current state. I will go back and fix all the elements once I have built a better knowledge base, experience and have more time.

Whilst This project gave me a great insight into how challenging coding can actually be I have come out the other end with a project that I am not overly happy with but with a much better plan on how to approach the next one and a vastly improved knowledge in javascript which was my main goal as a developer, so from that sense it was a success.  On my next project I will be keeping things very simple and building up rather than trying anything too complex and too far out of my comfort zone.
